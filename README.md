Hey everyone, its me, technical_.!
Honestly, I don't have much to say, but I'm thankful for all the support and motivation
people have given me. Without further ado, I showcase, Think-Tree, a app designed to 
support organization and project mapping. 

Think Tree is designed for:
Students organizing study materials
Writers planning stories
Project managers mapping workflows
Anyone who thinks visually

About this project:
This has been a blast to create, with so much key aspects, and so much learning involved on my part.
I wanted to deliver a simple, intuitive interface, built for people who have big dreams!
I came up with an idea of nodes, basic, or specific ideas that could be linked together.
Just like a family tree, each idea is interconnected, and has visual representations to show connections, which are called edges.
